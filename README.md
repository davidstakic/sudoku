# Sudoku Solver – University Project (C++)

This repository contains a **Sudoku game and solver** implemented in C++ as part of a **university project** focused on **object-oriented programming** (OOP) and **file handling**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to deepen understanding of object-oriented principles in C++ through the development of a Sudoku application. The project also emphasizes working with input/output files instead of console-based interaction.

## 🧩 Project Features

- Users can **solve Sudoku puzzles manually** by editing a file.
- Users can **provide a Sudoku puzzle** in a file, and the **program will solve it automatically**.
- Core functionality is implemented using **OOP concepts** such as:
  - Classes and objects
  - Encapsulation and modularity

## 📁 How It Works

### Input:
- The user provides a `.txt` file containing a 9x9 Sudoku grid.
- Empty cells are represented with `0`.

### Modes:
1. **Manual Mode:**
   - The user opens and edits the input file to fill in values manually.
2. **Automatic Solving:**
   - The program reads a puzzle from the file and attempts to solve it using backtracking.

### Output:
- The result is saved to a `.txt` file.
- Clear formatting ensures readability and usability.

## 🧠 Technologies

- C++
